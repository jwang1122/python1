✔️❌❓

* ❓ How many math problems do i need to complete? 
>✔️at least first 10.

# i did 42...

* ❓ How do I remove the quotes that appears when i run this code?.
```py
a = input("Input first name: ")
b = input("Input last name: ")
c = (a)
d = (b)
print("Hello %a, %a!" %(c,d))
```

❓ When i run the code below, the "diameter = x+x" gives me x*11 instead of x*2(meaning if i inputed 3, the result was 33, not 6), and even after changing it to x*2, the code would still do the problem stated above. how should i fix?
```py
x = input("Enter a radius: ")
r = float(x)
diameter = x*2
print("the diameter is ", diameter)
```

❓ When i run the code below, it tells me "can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'". how do I make it so that i can run the math properly?
```py
from math import pi
x = input("Enter a radius: ")
r = x
area = r*r
print("the area is %s", (area))
```
output:
can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
^ apparently i cannot do basic math problems with integers (the number as input was 3)
